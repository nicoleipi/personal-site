# Intro

I am student researcher and leader looking constantly on the lookout for new opportunities. I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, robotics, social impact, and mathematical modeling. Feel free to reach out, I love a good chat!

# Some history

When I was 7, my dad took me to his workplace, a small officespace in downtown San Diego. The desktop computers were large, loud and mysterious. Ever since then, I've been learning the language of computers, trying to understand them, and utilizing them as a aid to my creativity.
